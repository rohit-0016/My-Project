In recent years, City hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotelâ€™s primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to address the problem.

The analysis of hotel booking cancellations as well as other factors that have no bearing on their business and yearly revenue generation are the main topics of the report.
